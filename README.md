# Conectar - Website

Welcome to **Conectar**, a website designed as a landing page for my father's computing business.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components and efficiently manage the application's state.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. It helps prevent errors during development and improves code quality.

- **Vite**: An ultra-fast build and development system for web applications. It provides an agile and efficient workflow.

- **Formik**: A form management library for React. It simplifies the task of handling and validating forms, enhancing the user experience.

- **EmailJS**: A service for sending emails directly from the client. It facilitates email integration into the application without the need for a server.

4. Replace the placeholders with your EmailJS credentials in the code.
5. Check the interface where the data is sent to EmailJS to customize the email template accordingly.
